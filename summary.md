# RAJA_PROJECT
Arduino on cloud     TASK 1 Incorporating new components
component used :
  1.   DHT11 SENSOR
  2.   ESP8266 NODEMCU
  STEP1 : I used two components dht11 sensor and ESP8266 and then i connected the pins i.e 
  vcc with vin
  dataout with D1
  GND with GND
  
  STEP2 : By the help of type b cable i connected my hardware with laptop
  
  STEP 3 : After completing my circuit ,I wrote the code on arduinoIDE and added the DHT11 library.
 
  STEP4 : I uploded code and open serial monitor to show output
         At the end task completed and temperature & Humidity senses by sensor , data read by hardware and shown in output.
